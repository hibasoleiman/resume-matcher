"""
Pydantic models used across the pipeline.

These classes are the contracts between modules. Every LLM call in this
project returns structured data shaped like one of these models — that's
how we guarantee the agent's output is valid JSON with the right fields
instead of free-form text we'd have to parse ourselves.

When Claude is asked to "call the record_candidate tool", we hand it a
JSON schema generated from CandidateProfile. Claude's response must match
that schema. Pydantic then validates it on our side.
