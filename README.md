# Resume-to-JD Matching Agent

**[Live demo](https://resume-matcher-hsm7.onrender.com/)** — hosted on Render (free tier; first load may take ~50s to wake)

A teaching project that scores resume PDFs against a job description using
the Claude API.

Each resume goes through three steps, each a separate Python module:

1. **Parse** the PDF into plain text (`pdf_parser.py`, no LLM)
2. **Extract** structured info — name, skills, past roles, years of experience
   (`extractor.py`, one LLM call)
3. **Score** the candidate against the JD across four dimensions
   (`scorer.py`, one LLM call)

The output is a ranked JSON file plus a readable markdown report.

## How the code runs (end to end)

### Step 1: Entry point (`main.py`)

```
python main.py --jd sample_data/sample_jd.txt --resumes sample_data/resumes/
```

Python hits `if __name__ == "__main__"` and calls `main()`.

### Step 2: Parse arguments and validate

`main()` reads the command-line args (`--jd`, `--resumes`, `--output`, `--model`), then checks:

- Is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set?
- Does the JD file exist?
- Does the resumes directory exist?

If all good, it calls `run()`.

### Step 3: Setup

`run()` does two things:

1. **Reads the job description** from the text file into a string using `open()`
2. **Lists the resumes directory** using `os.listdir()` and collects all `.pdf` files

Then it creates an Anthropic API client and starts looping through each PDF.

### Step 4: Process each resume

For each PDF, `process_one()` runs a 3-stage pipeline. If any stage fails,
it records the error and moves on to the next resume.

**Stage A — Parse the PDF** (`src/pdf_parser.py`)

- Uses `pdfplumber` to extract raw text from the PDF
- No LLM involved here, just text extraction
- Input: `alice_chen.pdf` -> Output: a big string of resume text

**Stage B — Extract candidate profile** (`src/extractor.py`) — LLM call #1

- Sends the resume text to Claude with a system prompt saying "you are a resume parser"
- Uses **tool use**: defines a tool called `record_candidate` whose schema matches
  `CandidateProfile` (name, skills, years_experience, past_roles, education)
- Forces Claude to call that tool via `tool_choice` — so Claude **must** return
  structured JSON, not free text
- Validates the JSON with Pydantic to get a typed `CandidateProfile` object
- Input: raw text -> Output: structured profile like `{name: "Alice Chen", skills: ["Python", "ML"], ...}`

**Stage C — Score against the JD** (`src/scorer.py`) — LLM call #2

- Sends both the job description and the candidate profile to Claude
- System prompt says "you are a hiring evaluator"
- Again uses tool use: a tool called `record_score` matching `ScoreReport` schema
- Claude scores 4 dimensions (0-100 each): skills_match, experience_match, role_relevance, overall_fit
- Also returns reasoning and gaps
- Input: JD + profile -> Output: `ScoredCandidate` with scores like `{overall_fit: 85, skills_match: 90, ...}`

**Stage D — Bias audit (optional)** (`src/bias_auditor.py`) — LLM call × N swap variants

- Only runs if you pass `--bias-audit`
- Takes the extracted `CandidateProfile` and creates copies with one demographic signal swapped at a time: candidate name (4 variants covering gender × ethnicity) and graduation year (1 variant probing age bias). Location swaps (`LOCATION_SWAPS`) are defined but excluded from the default set — opt in by passing them explicitly to `run_bias_audit(swaps=...)`
- Re-scores each mutated copy against the JD using the same scoring LLM
- Computes the absolute score delta per dimension for each variant vs the baseline
- If any delta exceeds the threshold (default 10 pts), the candidate is flagged
- Output: a drift table per candidate in `report.md` and a full `bias_audit.json`

### Step 5: Write output (`src/reporter.py`)

After all resumes are processed, `run()`:

1. Creates the output directory
2. Writes `results.json` — all candidates ranked by overall_fit score, plus any errors
3. Writes `report.md` — a readable markdown table with rankings, per-candidate score breakdowns, and gaps

### The big picture

```
PDF file
   |  pdfplumber
Raw text
   |  Claude + tool use (LLM #1)
Structured profile
   |  Claude + tool use (LLM #2)
Scores + reasoning
   |  Claude × N swaps (LLM #3…N, optional)
Bias audit report
   |
results.json + report.md + bias_audit.json
```

The key pattern that repeats in every LLM call: **define a tool from a Pydantic
schema -> force Claude to call it -> validate the response back into a Pydantic
object**. This guarantees structured, typed output every time.

## What's being taught

- Reading structured data out of LLM responses using Claude's **tool use**
  feature + **Pydantic** for validation.
- A **prompt** module where all LLM instructions live in one place, so you
  can iterate on wording without touching the surrounding code.
- **Prompt caching** — the JD is identical across every resume in a run, so
  Claude serves it from cache at ~10% of the normal cost.
- An optional **bias audit** that probes for demographic sensitivity by
  re-scoring the same candidate with swapped name, graduation year, and
  location signals, then measuring score drift across dimensions.
- An **eval harness** for testing LLM pipelines, because you can't assert
  exact-score equality on a probabilistic output. Includes both scoring
  range evals and bias stability evals.

No asyncio, no frameworks, no agent libraries. Everything is plain
synchronous Python you can read top-to-bottom in one sitting.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Generate the sample resumes (they're not checked in):

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_sample_resumes.py
```

This creates five fictional candidates in `sample_data/resumes/`. Edit
[scripts/generate_sample_resumes.py](scripts/generate_sample_resumes.py)
and re-run to experiment.

## Run

Basic run — score all resumes against the job description:

```bash
python main.py \
    --jd sample_data/sample_jd.txt \
    --resumes sample_data/resumes/ \
    --output output/
```

With bias audit — re-scores each candidate with demographic signals swapped
and reports score drift per dimension:

```bash
python main.py \
    --jd sample_data/sample_jd.txt \
    --resumes sample_data/resumes/ \
    --bias-audit
```

Flags:

- `--model MODEL_ID` — override the Claude model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- `--output DIR` — override the output directory (default: `./output`)
- `--bias-audit` — re-score each candidate with demographic signals swapped
  (name, graduation year) and report score drift. Adds 5 extra LLM calls per
  resume (4 name variants covering gender × ethnicity + 1 grad year variant
  probing age bias). Pass `swaps=LOCATION_SWAPS` to `run_bias_audit()` to
  also include location variants.

Outputs:

- `output/results.json` — machine-readable ranked list plus any errors
- `output/report.md` — human-readable markdown report; includes a per-candidate
  drift table when `--bias-audit` is used
- `output/bias_audit.json` — full audit data per candidate (only written when
  `--bias-audit` is used)

## Web UI

The same pipeline is also available as a Streamlit app — upload a JD and a
folder of resumes, watch it process, and view ranked results (with an
optional bias audit toggle) in the browser:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

This is what's deployed live (see [render.yaml](https://resume-matcher-hsm7.onrender.com/)).

## Test

Fast local tests for the deterministic parts of the pipeline (parser and
reporter) — no LLM calls:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Evals

LLM calls can't be unit-tested with exact equality — scores move a few
points call to call. So we test *properties* of the output: a strong-match
resume should score 80+ overall, a weak-match resume should score under 45,
and so on.

```bash
uv run python -m src.evals
```

Runs the golden cases in [tests/evals/cases.py](tests/evals/cases.py)
through the real `extract -> score` pipeline and checks each dimension
against an expected range. Also runs bias stability cases that assert a
clearly qualified candidate's scores don't shift when demographic signals
are swapped. Exits nonzero on any failure.

```bash
uv run python -m src.evals --bias
```

Run only the bias stability cases (faster when iterating on audit prompts).

Add a scoring case by appending to `ALL_CASES`. Add a bias stability case
by appending to `ALL_BIAS_CASES` using the `BiasAuditEvalCase` dataclass.
When you iterate on a prompt, run the evals to see whether the change moved
scores in the right direction.

## Design notes

- **One LLM call per stage, not per field.** Structured output via tool use
  means one call returns every field at once — the full `messages.create()`
  call with `tools`, `tool_choice`, and `model_validate` lives in one place
  (`extractor.py`).
- **Prompts are data, code is logic.** All prompts live in
  [src/prompts.py](src/prompts.py). You can change wording without touching
  any function.
- **Bad PDFs don't crash the run.** Each resume is wrapped in try/except. A
  failure at any stage becomes a `ProcessingError` in the output instead of
  stopping the batch.
- **Bias audit is additive, not destructive.** `--bias-audit` appends a
  drift table to each candidate's section in `report.md` and writes a
  separate `bias_audit.json`. It never changes scores — it only reports
  whether the model would have scored differently with different demographic
  signals. The audit fails safely: a broken variant is logged and skipped,
  the scored candidate is always returned regardless.
